Visceral Color Project

This project is a website that, lets users upload sets of images and choose
a focus set to compare palettes to. Then the server will generate a 4-color 
palette for each set and display these palettes in a website and mobile view.
Users can also interact with the display by dragging and dropping the colors
to change the colors of different elements in the display.

File uploading is done by sending an ajax POST request to the server which
will then give the image a unique identifier and move it into the 
public/images/tmp folder. Then the UID is stored in a sqlite3 database.

After images are uploaded, the program sends a POST request to the
pictaculous api at http://pictaculous.com/api/1.0/ which will
return the 6 main colors each picture. See palette.py for more
information about the color choosing algorithm applied after.

How to run/setup
================

If given errors with palette generation:

The python executable may need to be modified to have the path to your
python. It is default set to /bin/python. To find where your python is 
located, run "which python" in the terminal. Then replace the first 
line of palette.py with "#!" and then the path.

For this project we also need to install the python colour
module. If you have pip installed, do this by running "pip install colour"
in the terminal.

Also, make sure that the executable has the 'x' property. To change this
run "chmod +x palette.py"

To run the server, run "node vcp_server.js" in the terminal and then
open a browser at localhost:8080 to see the website.
